### Project Overview

 my project includes overview of string functions, and Lambda functions accompanied by High order functions like map() in python.
I have learnt to merge two messages and how to perfectly write message using python codes.


### Learnings from the project

 I have completed two projects with grey atom, the recent of them was Spy-games project. With each processes of the project I gained prior knowledge of handling problems with python and was able to understand topics taught to me by grey atom more.  I learnt to code for forming messages and merging them prior to obtain outputs .


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used alot of hints (_which i know i should've avoided_) because i was very new to the python until today. I found this topic hard, but with daily practice i know i will excel. 



### Challenges faced

 In the beginning i could'nt understand the  algorithm, but coming to the end of project i can code now.


### Additional pointers

 avoid using hints and seeing solutions, but there is a problem with this window, it does not run even if u have written right codes, sometimes. so i had to tally my solutions but found no errors still i lost my marks!
